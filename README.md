# Tomato
A library to calculate parametric maps in MRI. It contains ShMOLLI implementation as in [this article](https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1532-429X-12-69).

## Tomato and Numerical Recipes

**Important**  
Original ShMOLLI (and based on it Tomato) uses code based on Numerical Recipes book. Due to Numerical Recipes licence I cannot share this part of the code online. Please contact me if you would like to use this part of the code. To make up for this limitation we provide a number of alternative fitting procedures. 

# Software Requirements Specification

1. Calculate ShMOLLI with exactly the same results as these from the previous implementation.
2. API for easily choosing
    * a map calculation algorithm,
    * a fitting algorithm,
    * a model function and corresponding energy function.
3. Compatibility with:
    * main operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux),
    * C++98 (to include the library in older code).
4. Handling DICOM files.
5. Fast calculation.
6. Easily interfaced to calculation environments MATLAB, IDL and Python.  

# Coding style

* Underscore (`_variable`) means a class member variable.
* C++98 does not allow me to use constructor delegation. I am using methods like `setAllPointersToNull()` to make up for it.
* Order of methods in a class definition: 
    * functional (calculation, helpers etc)
    * getters/setters
    * disp()
    * constructors/destructors
* In **copy constructors** copy primitive types, set all pointers to zero.

# Notes

* **Continuous integration** was tested [in this repo](https://github.com/MRKonrad/ContinousIntegrationPlayground).
* **Gitmodules**: after `git clone` run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to get the submodules code.
* It would be nice to follow [CppCoreGuidlines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md) as far as C++98 allows.
* Maybe I can write a script for github releases with [github releases REST api](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) and [curl REST api](http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/how-to-test-a-rest-api-from-command-line-with-curl/#12_HEAD_requests)?

# TODO: 

* provide template yaml config files
* scripts for python
* processing without phase data
