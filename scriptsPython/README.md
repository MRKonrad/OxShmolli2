# TOMATO and Python

In this folder you can find a basic matlab script allowing to work with TOMATO by calling tomato executable from Python.
An example scenarios on how you could use it:
*   read yaml file, modify it, save yaml file, call TOMATO passing the new file as input
*   generate a new yaml file, call TOMATO passing the new file as input
