# TOMATO and MATLAB

In this folder you can find a basic matlab script allowing to work with TOMATO by calling tomato executable from MATLAB.
An example scenarios on how you could use it:
*   read yaml file, modify it, save yaml file, call TOMATO passing the new file as input
*   generate a new yaml file, call TOMATO passing the new file as input

Currently I am working on a more advanced solution, please take a look at <https://github.com/MRKonrad/tomato_matlab>
