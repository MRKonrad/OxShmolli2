\subsection*{Coding style}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Write code compatible with C++98
\item Use underscore ({\ttfamily \+\_\+variable}) in the name of a class member variable.
\item C++98 does not allow me to use constructor delegation. Using methods like {\ttfamily set\+All\+Pointers\+To\+Null()} to make up for it.
\item Order of methods in a class definition\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item functional (calculation, helpers etc)
\item getters/setters
\item disp()
\item constructors/destructors
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In {\bfseries copy constructors} copy primitive types, set all pointers to zero.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Commiting style}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Folow \href{https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/}{\tt conventional commits} recommendations. \href{https://www.cheatography.com/albelop/cheat-sheets/conventional-commits/pdf/}{\tt A cheetsheet is here}.
